# Tandem-SE-Apprentice-Challenge-2020

The challenge was to create a trivia game where users could view questions and select an answer from multiple choices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Questions and their corresponding answer choices can be viewed at one time.
- Questions do not duplicate.
- Only one answer of four possible choices can be selected.
- The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer 
- A user can see the score they received at the end of the round.

## Known Issues
In order to create a round of 10 I generated a random array to shuffle the questions which presented a problem with duplicate questions. None of the solutions I tried created a game with uniques questions but I decided to risk duplicates rather than create a game where every round has the same questions in the same order.

## Future Improvements
I would definitely work to solve my duplicates issue. Additionally, I would add a timing feature where the incorrect answers disappear as time goes down leaving the correct answer as time is up.
